# ASP.NET-CORE
I have been programming for three years, but recently i want to change my job.However mostly IT companies need BS programmer,I begin to learn from zero Now.

Create this repository aims at leaving a trace on my learning and helping programmers like me to be familiar with how to transfer to a new platform.
I don't think its difficult , are you ?

At first, we should know a BS project contains two parts, the front end and the server end. Thus i think in fact it's just a procedure of RPC.We use explorer to display our webpage, it consists of  html and javacript. the server need to send webpages that we have written to explorer, but how it works? what kind of server we use? how to deploy our program to server? Let's put all apart,just coding.

When i search documents for ASP .NET Core,i found many of manuals take a lot about ASP .NET, it seems to be two things. Maybe i should take a look at ASP .NET .
